Bootcamp Module 09 Challenge - ReadMe Generator

Professional README generator is application that takes user input on a Node.js command line interface and generates a README.md file for Github. It prompts the user for information about their project, such as the project name, description, and installation instructions. The tool would then use that information to generate a README.md file with the appropriate formatting and content. The user could then upload the generated file to their Github repository. The generated README file contains a badge and table of contents.
